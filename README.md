# Rock Scissor Paper Game (in ReactJS)
I have written this Rock Scissor Paper game in ReactJS to complete a task I have receive that should include the following functions:

- Player vs. Computer
- Computer vs. Computer
- Save the game score, even when refreshing the browser
- Desktop and mobile responsive



You can find the game and the source code [here on CodePen](https://codepen.io/alexiovay/pen/rEEmEz?editors=0110#0). I haven't uploaded the files here since I might be still working on the code, directly on CodePen.
